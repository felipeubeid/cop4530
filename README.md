# COP 4530 - Data Structures, Algorithms, and Generic Programming II Projects

This repository contains projects completed for COP4530 in Fall using C++. 
The projects demonstrate understanding of core data structures, algorithms, and programming practices covered throughout the semester.

## Projects Overview

1. Word, number, and character usage statistics
   1. Implemented a program that collects the statistics of word, number, and character usage in a file (redirected as the standard input)
2. Doubly-linked list container and its applications
   1. Implemented a doubly-linked list class template List and its associated iterators
   2. Developed a application that emulates the memory management in an OS using the implemented doubly-linked list
3. Stack and its applications
   1. Implemented a generic stack container as an adaptor class template
   2. Implemented a program that converts an infix expression to a postfix expression, and evaluates the postfix expression using the stack container developed
4.  Binary tree and its applications
   1. Implemented a binary expression tree and used it to convert postfix expressions into infix expressions
5. Hash tables and its applications
   1. Implemented a hash table ADT and other supporting user interfaces
   2. Develop a simple password server program
6. Analyzed the time complexity of certain functions from projects 2-5

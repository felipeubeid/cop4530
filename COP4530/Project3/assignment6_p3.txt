1) Analyzing the worst-case time complexity of the member function clear() of Stack.
The clear() function of Stack has O(n) complexity, as it uses deque's clear() function, which has O(n) complexity, where n
is the number of elements in the deque.

2) Analyzing the worst-case time complexity of the function you developed to evaluate a postfix arithmetic expression.
The function to avaluate a postfix arithmetic expression also has O(n) complexity. The operations outside the loop have
O(1) complexity, while the operations inside the loop also have O(1) complexity. The loop has complexity O(n), where n is
the amount of iterations it goes through. Therefore, the constant time operations outside and inside of it are negligible,
as O(1) has a lower order than O(n), making the function's complexity O(n).
